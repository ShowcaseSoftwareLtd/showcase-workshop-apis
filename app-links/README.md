# App Links

## Link to the Showcase App (incoming links)

You can open the Showcase app from other apps (or a web browser) in iOS and Android using the following URLs:

Open app: `https://app.showcaseworkshop.com/main/app-link/`

Open app and select workshop 12 (if user has access): `https://app.showcaseworkshop.com/main/app-link/workshop/12`

Open app and select workshop 12 then showcase 34 (if user has access, if showcase not downloaded, start downloading it then open it when download done):
`https://app.showcaseworkshop.com/main/app-link/workshop/12/showcase/34`


## Link from a Showcase to a different app (outgoing links)

Get the URL for the other app (eg, `https://twitter.com/nasa`)

Enter this as the URL for a Hotspot in the editor and tick the 'Open Externally' tickbox.

When tapping the Hotspot in iOS, Android or Windows Showcase will ask the operating system to open the URL.  If the user has the Twitter app installed this will then trigger the app to be opened and NASA selected.
